# OctoPrint SimplyPrint Power Controller
**_This project is a slightly modified fork of kantlivelong's [OctoPrint-PSUControl](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl)_** 

This OctoPrint plugin makes the _SimplyPrint Power Controller_ work, as well as any other ATX/AUX power supply, to help reduce power consumption and noise when the printer is not in use.

The power supply can be automatically switched on upon start of print, bed leveling, filament change and any other operation that requires the printer to be turned on. 

Supports Commands (G-Code or System) or GPIO to switch power supply on/off.
